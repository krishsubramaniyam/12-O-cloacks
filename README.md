# 12 o'clocks

This repository hosts a collaborative p5.js port of John Maeda's 12 o'clocks,
originally written for Mac OS 9 and released in 1997. Due to the Power PC
hardware that Mac OS 9 ran on, it is very hard to emulate the original artwork
and without access to a Mac of the era it is difficult to view. Therefore, we
are collaborating to bring John Maeda's 12 o'clocks to the web in p5.js. The
current version is available to be viewed at this repository's [GitHub Pages][0]

## Resources

Possibly the most useful resource for this is a post from Golan Levin on the
[12 o'clocks][1]. Golan Levin has created some very useful GIFs of all 12 of
the clocks in action.

There is also a useful [video][2] on vimeo from John Maeda including each of
the 12'oclocks in acton (From around 4:00 through to 6:20).

If you can emulate Mac OS 9 or have a working Mac of the era, the software is
still available from John Maeda's [website][3]

## Contributing

It would be great if you want to help out and recreate the 12 o'clocks, or if
you have any more useful resources for the project. If you are new to git, you
can check out [Git and GitHub for Poets][2], otherwise feel free to fork this
repository and create a Pull Request with your changes. Need help? Feel free
to raise an issue if there's anything we can help you with!

Each clock has its own sketch file in the clocks folder, numbered 01 to 12
based on the position of the clock in the grid.
